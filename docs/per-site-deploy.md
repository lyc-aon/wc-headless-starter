# Per-site deployment guide

How to use this scaffold as a template for multiple independent WP +
WooCommerce sites. Target pattern: **one shared codebase, one SPA build,
N isolated WP installs** - each with its own database, its own brand,
its own origin.

This matches the runtime model where one codebase can serve many isolated
sites, but deployment ownership is explicit. The upstream GitHub Actions
workflow is manual-only. Client-owned forks should use single-site auto-deploy
workflows with repo-local secrets. Do not auto-deploy unrelated client sites
from one shared push unless you intentionally own that whole fleet.

## What lives where

| Layer | Per-site or shared? |
|---|---|
| mu-plugins (`wp/mu-plugins/*.php`) | **Shared code.** Deployed identically to every site. |
| WP shim theme (`wp/themes/headless-shim/`) | **Shared code.** |
| SPA bundle (`spa/build/`) | **Shared code.** One build, served to every site. |
| `wp-config.php` constants | **Per-site.** Each install has its own. |
| MySQL database | **Per-site.** Each install has its own DB (or its own DB on a shared server). |
| `wp_woocommerce_sessions` table | **Per-site** (lives in the per-site DB). |
| Cart-Token JWTs | **Per-site** (signed with `@.wp_salt()` which is per-site). |
| MySQL `GET_LOCK` lock names | **Per-site** (prefixed with `DB_NAME` hash). |

Nothing leaks between sites. JWTs from site A won't validate on site B.
Cart locks are scoped per-DB. Runtime config is resolved per site from
that site's own DB options plus any per-site `wp-config.php` secrets or
intentional overrides.

---

## Per-site `wp-config.php` constants

Add these to each site's `wp-config.php`, above the `/* That's all, stop
editing! */` line:

```php
// ---- Headless WC Starter - per-site configuration ----

// Brand name shown in the SPA header. Defaults to the site title if
// omitted.
define( 'WCHS_BRAND_NAME', 'Example Shop' );

// Optional: lock timeout in seconds for concurrent cart writes
// (default 5). Raise if you expect long-running plugins in the
// add-to-cart hook chain.
// define( 'WCHS_CART_LOCK_TIMEOUT', 10 );

// Optional: disable the cart lock if a site's cart hooks are known
// to be safe without serialization (NOT recommended).
// define( 'WCHS_CART_LOCK_ENABLED', false );

// Optional: only for local dev or an intentional split-origin deployment.
// Normal production sites should stay in same-origin mode and let WCHS
// derive these automatically from home_url().
// define( 'WCHS_SPA_URL', 'https://spa.example.com' );
// define( 'WCHS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS', 'https://spa.example.com' );
// define( 'WCHS_RETURN_ORIGINS', 'https://spa.example.com' );
```

For multiple environments (dev/staging/prod) on the same site, gate
with `WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE`:

```php
if ( wp_get_environment_type() === 'local' ) {
    define( 'WCHS_SPA_URL',         'http://localhost:5175' );
    define( 'WCHS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS', 'http://localhost:5175,http://127.0.0.1:5175' );
    define( 'WCHS_RETURN_ORIGINS',  'http://localhost:5175,http://127.0.0.1:5175' );
} else {
    define( 'WCHS_BRAND_NAME',      'Example Shop' );
}
```

## SPA runtime configuration

The SPA fetches its config from `GET /wp/wp-json/wchs/v1/config` on
mount. The response shape:

```json
{
  "wp_origin": "https://shop.example.com",
  "spa_origin": "https://shop.example.com",
  "brand_name": "Example Shop",
  "currency_code": "USD",
  "currency_symbol": "$",
  "features": {
    "guest_checkout": true,
    "dark_mode": true,
    "pretext": true
  },
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

**You don't rebuild the SPA per site.** One build, one bundle, N sites.
The SPA reads `window.location.origin` for its own origin and fetches
everything else from `/wp/wp-json/wchs/v1/config`.

---

## Nginx proxy - the `/wp/*` convention

Both the dev (Vite) and prod (nginx) setups proxy `/wp/*` on the SPA
origin to the WP origin. Same-origin requests from the SPA mean no
CORS dance, cookies flow naturally, and the runtime config URL
(`/wp/wp-json/wchs/v1/config`) is portable across environments.

Example nginx block for `shop.example.com`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name shop.example.com;

    # Static SPA bundle
    root /var/www/wchs-spa;
    index index.html;

    # SvelteKit Node adapter (if using SSR)
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # WP backend at /wp/*
    location /wp/ {
        # Strip /wp prefix before forwarding
        rewrite ^/wp/(.*)$ /$1 break;
        proxy_pass http://wp-backend-shop.example.com;
        proxy_set_header Host shop.example.com;  # keep original host so
                                                  # WP knows its own origin
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Or if you prefer a subdomain split (`shop.example.com` for SPA,
`wp.shop.example.com` for WP), you still proxy `/wp/*` on the SPA side
to `wp.shop.example.com/*` so the SPA's Store API calls are same-origin.
This also simplifies CORS (none needed in the happy path).

---

## Database isolation

Each site has its own database. The cart-lock plugin includes `DB_NAME`
in the hash of its lock names, so even if two sites share a MySQL
server, their cart locks cannot collide:

```
wchs_cart_<hash(DB_NAME + cart_token)>
```

The `@.wp_salt()` used by WC's Cart-Token JWT is per-site (each site
has its own salts in wp-config), so tokens from site A can't be
replayed on site B.

`wp_woocommerce_sessions` is a per-site table - no cross-contamination.

---

## Deploy checklist per new site

1. Provision a WordPress install pointing at a new/clean database
2. Copy this repo's `wp/mu-plugins/*.php` into `wp-content/mu-plugins/`
3. Copy `wp/themes/headless-shim/` into `wp-content/themes/`
4. Activate: WooCommerce and the `headless-shim` theme. Add payment,
   shipping, analytics, or email plugins only when the site needs them.
5. Add the per-site constants to `wp-config.php` (see above)
6. **Set `WP_DEBUG` to `false`** (enables application-level rate limiting)
7. **Configure real IP forwarding** in nginx (see below)
8. **Add infrastructure-level rate limiting** in nginx or Cloudflare
9. Verify `GET https://shop.example.com/wp-json/wchs/v1/config` returns
   the expected JSON
10. Point the shared SPA bundle at this origin (add nginx vhost)
11. Smoke test: `curl https://shop.example.com/wp-json/wc/store/v1/products`

No per-site code changes. Just config + infra.

---

## Rate limiting & real IP (REQUIRED for production)

The custom `/wchs/v1/` endpoints have application-level rate limiting
(per-IP, transient-backed). **WooCommerce and WordPress native endpoints
have zero rate limiting.** You need infrastructure-level protection.

### Real IP forwarding

Behind any reverse proxy, `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` is the proxy's IP, not
the client's. Without real IP forwarding, **all visitors share one rate limit
bucket** and one aggressive client locks out everyone.

If behind Cloudflare, add `real_ip_header CF-Connecting-IP;` plus all CF IP
ranges to your nginx config. If behind a plain nginx proxy, use
`X-Forwarded-For`. See `SECURITY.md` for the full config block.

### Infrastructure rate limits

Add these to your nginx config (or equivalent Cloudflare WAF rules):

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=wpapi:10m rate=5r/s;
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=wccart:10m rate=1r/s;

location /wp-json/ {
    limit_req zone=wpapi burst=20 nodelay;
}

location ~ /wp-json/wc/store/v1/cart/(add-item|update-item|remove-item) {
    limit_req zone=wccart burst=5 nodelay;
}
```

Full details in `SECURITY.md`.

## What IS shared across sites (and why that's fine)

- **mu-plugin code** - reads per-site constants; behavior differs per
  site based on config
- **SPA bundle** - reads per-site config from `/wchs/v1/config`; behavior
  differs per site based on response
  has its own funnel/upsell configuration in its own DB
- **WordPress core** - standard

Nothing in the shared layer has per-site knowledge baked in. All
per-site behavior comes from either (a) per-site DB content or (b)
per-site `wp-config.php` constants.

---

## What is NOT shared

- Databases
- Media uploads (each site's `/wp-content/uploads/`)
- Session rows
- Orders
- Customers
- Tier pricing tables
- Any cart state whatsoever

This is the hard isolation boundary.
